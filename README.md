# About Me

Hi. I'm Joshua Kraitberg a 7th semester student at Seneca College enrolled in the Software Development program.   

## Skills

#### Transferable
* Time management
  * For the first two months of internship supervisor was on vacation.  
  * Ended up several weeks ahead of schedule.
* Research
  * Those first two months were spent mostly researching and testing AI techniques.
  * Read numerous academic papers, searching for optimal algorithms.
* Teaching peers
  * Because of my previous programming experience I was able to gain more from research then coworkers.
  * Taught and demonstrated the techniques acquired from research to help them learn faster.
  * Increased workflow speed by sharing knowledge of several other mini-projects.  

#### Technical
* Applied AI experience using Python
  * My first intership entailed creating a classifier for legal documents.
  * Explored variety of algorithms across several libraries.
  * Created numerous other tools to accelerate data collection pipeline. 
* C++ and CUDA optimization experience
  * Created a highly-optimized kernel to accelerate GaussianBlur algorithm.
  * Profiled and documented performance increases.

#### Artifacts
* [GaussianBlur CUDA Optimization](https://wiki.cdot.senecacollege.ca/wiki/BETTERRED)
  * Using an existing tool found on GitHub, CUDA optimizations were added and a performance report was created,
  ![Example Pic GaussianBlur](Artifacts/GaussianBlurCUDA/Cinque_terre_BLURRED.jpg "This is what a blurred picture looks like")

* [Turing RayTracer](Artifacts/RayTracer)
  * Created a back when I was  in highschool.  Written in Turing.

* [Critical Security Flaw Audit](#)
  * This is ongoing.  Top secret critical flaws were found, currently being reported.
  * Estimated time of release: **Januray 2018**.
