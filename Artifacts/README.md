## [Gaussian Blur CUDA Optimization](https://wiki.cdot.senecacollege.ca/wiki/BETTERRED)
Using an existing tool found on GitHub, CUDA optimizations were added and a performance report was created.
The goal of this project was to find and asses possible candidate programs for CUDA optimization.
My group and I chose a Gaussian Blur program as our main candidate.

## [Turing RayTracer](RayTracer)
Created back when I was in high school.  Written in Turing.
This was a long time ago, I can't remember much but I enjoyed writing it.

## Critical Security Flaws Discovery
  * This is ongoing.  Top secret critical flaws were found, currently being reported.
  * Estimated time of release: **January 2018**.    

## [Polytechnics Canada 2017 Interview](http://www.polytechnicscanada.ca/events/polytechnics-canada-annual-conference-2017-0)
Gave an interview about my job and Seneca College.  The video is apperently hosted on this site somewhere, but I've never been able to find it.
